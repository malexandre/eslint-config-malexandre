# What is this project

This is my personal config for eslint, tweaked over some time. To reuse it easily between each of my project, I made it into an npm/yarn package.

## How to use it

1. `npm install --save-dev eslint-config-malexandre` or `yarn add -D eslint-config-malexandre`
1. Add this to your `.eslintrc`:

```json
"extends": [
    "malexandre"
]
```
